/*
 * Memory Segments Diagram
 * ----------------------
 * This diagram illustrates the typical memory layout of a C program with the code segment at the bottom (lowest memory
 * addresses) and the stack at the top (highest memory addresses). The diagram is oriented with the lowest addresses at the
 * bottom of the ASCII art and the highest at the top, as requested. Note: Actual addresses and segment order may vary
 * depending on the OS, compiler, and linker. Addresses are virtual and may be affected by alignment, ASLR, or linker scripts.
 *
 * High Memory Addresses
 * +-------------------------+
 * | Stack                   |  <- Local variables, function call frames (e.g., main_local, local_var)
 * | (Grows downward)        |
 * +-------------------------+
 * | ... (free memory) ...   |
 * +-------------------------+
 * | Heap                    |  <- Dynamically allocated memory (e.g., malloc, calloc)
 * | (Grows upward)          |
 * +-------------------------+
 * | Data Segment            |
 * |   - Read-only Data      |  <- String literals (e.g., "Hello, World!") in .rodata
 * |   - BSS (uninitialized) |  <- Uninitialized global/static variables (e.g., global_uninitialized)
 * |   - Initialized Data    |  <- Initialized global/static variables (e.g., global_initialized, static_global)
 * +-------------------------+
 * | Code Segment (.text)    |  <- Executable instructions (e.g., main, demonstrate_memory)
 * | (Read-only)             |
 * +-------------------------+
 * Low Memory Addresses
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Code Segment: Stores the program's executable code, typically at the lowest addresses.
 * - Data Segment: Includes initialized data (.data), uninitialized data (.bss), and read-only data (.rodata).
 * - Heap: Used for dynamic memory allocation, grows toward higher addresses.
 * - Stack: Used for local variables and function calls, starts at high addresses and grows downward.
 * - String literals are in .rodata (part of the data segment), not the code segment, despite being read-only.
