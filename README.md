## 🔍 About This Repository

This repository is a personal yet public commitment to **master the C programming language from the ground up** — not just to write code, but to truly understand how computers work.

Every line of code here serves a single purpose:  
> ⚙️ **Build deep system-level expertise that AI can't replace.**

## 💻 Why C?

C is not just a programming language — it’s the DNA of modern computing.  
By learning C deeply, I'm preparing to:

- Write secure, performant system software  
- Contribute to open-source Linux tools  
- Build and debug complex infra no AI can replace  
- Ultimately become a **Principal System Architect**

## 🧠 Next Steps

- [ ] Add first week's pointer examples
- [ ] Start Project 1: Student Records Manager (CLI)
- [ ] Push LeetCode practice (tagged + documented)
- [ ] Write Blog #1: "Why I Chose to Master C in 2025"
