# 👨‍💻 Shoaib — Future Principal System Architect | C & Systems Programming Enthusiast

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Shoaib — a system-level application developer with a strong foundation in C, UNIX, Shell scripting, and database technologies like Pro*C and PL/SQL. With over 4 years of experience in backend and systems programming, I'm currently on a focused journey to become a **Principal System Architect** and, ultimately, a **CTO**.

## 🎯 My Mission
To become a **top 1% coder in the world** by mastering:
- 🔧 System-level programming (C, Linux, Memory Management, OS internals)
- ☁️ Cloud-native architecture (Docker, Kubernetes, AWS)
- 🧠 Deep system design (Scalable, secure, performance-first systems)

---

## 💼 Current Role
**Application Designer/Developer** | [2025–Present]  
Working remotely on high-performance C-based backend systems, UNIX-based batch frameworks, and database integration using Pro*C and PL/SQL.

---

## 🔥 Current Focus (2025–2026)
| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ✅ C Projects | CLI Tools, Shells, Memory Allocators, Sockets |
| ✅ GitHub Growth | Clean repos, documented code, technical blogs |
| ✅ Cloud Mastery | AWS, Docker, Kubernetes (CKA Certified Path) |
| ✅ System Design | Reading *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* |

## 🚀 My System Projects

| Project | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| [`task-cli`](./projects/task-cli/) | Terminal-based To-Do Manager in C with file I/O and prioritization | 🔜 Planned |
| [`my-shell`](./projects/my-shell/) | Custom Linux shell using `fork()`, `exec()`, pipes, redirection | 🔜 Planned |
| [`kv-store`](./projects/kv-store/) | In-memory Key-Value DB (mini-Redis) with CLI and persistence | 🔜 Planned |
| [`my-malloc`](./projects/my-malloc/) | Custom memory allocator mimicking `malloc/free` | 🔜 Planned |
| [`simple-http-server`](./projects/http-server/) | Lightweight multi-threaded HTTP server in C | 🔜 Planned |

📁 **More coming soon!** Check `/projects/` for real-world code that reflects performance thinking and systems knowledge.
